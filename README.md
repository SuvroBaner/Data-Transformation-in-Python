# Data-Transformation-in-Python
It is a Parking Industry data transformation project.
This is a data transformation problem where we analyze a table of transaction data. Each row is a transaction record that includes the entry and exit time of a car, along with some other extra information.
The objective is to know the distribution of the amount of time people stay in the garage (called 'duration') based on their entry time.

The files in this repository has the following meaning-
a) data_transformation_v1  # Problem description
b) Smarking_Data_Transformation_Assignment_Suvro  # Solution using Python
c) transaction.csv  # data set
d) transactions.pkl # pickled file
e) transactions_info.txt # sample transactions information.

A further analysis can be done using various Statistical / Machine Learning techniques but this is not in scope for this repository.
